The goal of the course is to find a problem that can be expressed in relatively
simple terms, use a model to simulate the problem, and be able to say something
interesting about its results.

Because the exact problem definition is not fixed yet, the main goal of the
design is to provide a platform with which to experiment and compare different
solutions.
